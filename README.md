# Phase-1API

Game Search API project

This project required:
● All interactions handled asynchronously and use json communication format
● Must run on a single page
● Use at least 3 distinct event listeners that enable interactivity
● Return a collection of at least 5 objects, with each having 3 attributes
● Implement at least 1 array iteration using array methods

Project description: 
Showcase the latest trends in games as voted by peers. Results show which platforms you can use, star rating, release date and game cover art.

*New! Also the ability for someone to search by genre. Complete feature yet to be fully functional.

Project outcomes:
Initial design was made in figma to examine different search app layouts. Naturally as the project progressed the interactive features changed. Challenges of working with APIs were frustrating, I had extended my skills by using one that required a key. The smug was real when the magic happened.
