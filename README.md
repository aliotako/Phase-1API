# Phase-1API
the saga of talking to a brick wall

MUSIC API project

Project description: Provide the ability for someone to search by genre for a playlist. This returns 10 options to choose from and then provides the playlist tracks.

18/11 html+css framework done. layout designed in figma. search to be centred
19/11 search has dropdown feature. eventListener can be added here (keydown atm)
21/11 keeping styling seperate as api tests are not functioning
22/11 first successful api fetch. not able to use data though.
23/11 needed ability to clear results container - added function.

4 days of api headache. changed to spotify api, which had its own series of token woes and limitations. oh and the code was pretty repetitive - followed 4 tutorials and looked at 15 uses, all had the same layout. trying again with rapid api.

26/11 have needed to restart this. og repo was linked to something i forked and 1: had forgotten about because was only looking at it from my files not github and 2: exlains why there were push issues.
